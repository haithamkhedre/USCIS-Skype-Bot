# Payment Bot Sample

A sample bot showing how to integrate with Microsoft Wallet service for payment processing.


### Prerequisites

The minimum prerequisites to run this sample are:
* The latest update of Visual Studio 2015. You can download the community version [here](http://www.visualstudio.com) for free.
* Register your bot with the Microsoft Bot Framework. Please refer to [this](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/csharp/builder/sdkreference/gettingstarted.html#registering) for the instructions. Once you complete the registration, update the [Bot's Web.config](USCISBot/Web.config#L9-L11) file with the registered config values (MicrosoftAppId and MicrosoftAppPassword).
* Make sure to keep your bot in preview mode.  Payments is NDA.
* Email your `Bot handle` to Bot Framework Paltform Team: `bfcoreplatform@microsoft.com` to have your bot whitelisted for payments.
* You need a Microsoft wallet merchant id. Once you have the merchant id, update the [Bot's Web.config](USCISBot/Web.config#L15) file with your designated merchat id.  
* [Microsoft.Bot.Connector.Payments](https://fuselabs.visualstudio.com/PaymentSample/_packaging?feedName=packages&protocolType=NuGet&packageName=microsoft.bot.connector.payments&packageVersion=1.0.0&_a=view) nuget available from Fuse labs nuget feed: `https://fuselabs.pkgs.visualstudio.com/_packaging/packages/nuget/v3/index.json`. You can follow the instruction [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=698608) to setup this package source Visual Studio. NOTE: To access Fuse labs private nuget feed [here](https://fuselabs.visualstudio.com/PaymentSample/_packaging?feedName=packages&protocolType=NuGet&packageName=microsoft.bot.connector.payments&packageVersion=1.0.0&_a=view), view feed first via browser, then connect to feed and add URL in nuget package manager in VS


#### Microsoft Bot Builder

This sample has been developed based on Microsoft Bot Builder Dialog system. You can follow the following [sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/CSharp/core-MultiDialogs) to become familiar with different kind of dialogs and dialog stack in Bot Builder.
